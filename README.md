# Multi-Database Projects Showcase

This repository demonstrates practical implementations of three common SQL databases: **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, and **Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)**. Each project showcases how the same domain logic can be designed and implemented across different RDBMSs, offering a comparative insight into structure, performance, and design choices.

## 🗃️ Supported Databases

- **PostgreSQL** – Advanced features, extensibility, and standards compliance.
- **MySQL** – Fast, reliable, and widely used in web applications.
- **MSSQL** – Enterprise-grade database system with deep Microsoft ecosystem integration.
